- figure out GPUs and partitions that can use and fix
    - I think only l40s
- figure out memory/time requirement and minimize
    - have initial guess based in previous benchmarking
- test examples and fix errors
- check in af3cli with msa (exercise 04) respects null templates 
    - I beleive it does not -- needed to get AF3 to generate templates
    - after confirming, open issue
    - if not fixed in time, just run in no-template mode 
add --job-name to all the example submission scripts
    -we wont be able to find all the jobs otherwise
